# make-3s-data
Phase multilocus data and sample 3 sequences per locus for 3s analysis

Script that performs the following steps:
(1) Phase multilocus data of unphased diploid sequences using `PHASE` [(Stephens et al., 2001)](https://doi.org/10.1086/319501).
(2) Sample 3 phased sequences per locus using `bpp.3sdata`.

`bpp.3sdata` is a adapted from an original version written by Ziheng Yang for [Shi & Yang (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msx277).

This procedure was used in [Thawornwattana et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syac009).
