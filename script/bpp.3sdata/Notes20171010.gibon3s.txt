I modified bpp (version 3) to sample 3 sequences at each locus, with half of the
loci having the 123 configurations, a quarter with 113, and another
quarter with 223.  The program takes a bpp control file and read the 
bpp sequence data file.  It asks for input of three species indexes 
(according to species&tree line in the control file) and then generates 
a 3s input data file by sampling three sequences for each locus.

This is for the Gibbon paper Shi & Yang (2018 MBE).  You can take a look at that paper.
For example, for the gibbons data, we have the following in the bpp control file.

  species&tree = 6  Hm  Hp  B  S  N  O
                    2   2   4  4  4  1
                   (O, ((N, (B, S)), (Hm, Hp)));       * tree1 15.4%

Thus if you type 
1 3 6
at the screen prompt, you will be generating a file for the species triplet Hm-B-O.

If you can't make it work, i will send you the gibbons data file.

To compile, do something like the following:

cl -Ox bpp.3sdata.c tools.c
gcc -o bpp.3sdata.c -O3 bpp.3sdata.c tools.c


To run
bpp.3sdata
./bpp.3sdata


// end of file


Notes for myself: Besides the changes to bpp.c (copied in bpp.3sdata.c), comment out the
call to PatternWeight inside ReadSeq.
